This guide gives an overview of how to set up [training-operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator)
and how to run a Tensorflow job with YuniKorn scheduler. The training-operator is a unified training operator maintained by
Kubeflow. It not only supports TensorFlow but also PyTorch, XGboots, etc.

## Install training-operator
You can use the following command to install training operator in kubeflow namespace by default. If you have problems with installation,
please refer to [this doc](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator#installation) for details.
```
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/manifests/overlays/standalone?ref=v1.3.0"
```

## Prepare the docker image
Before you start running a TensorFlow job on Kubernetes, you'll need to build the docker image.
1. Download files from [deployment/examples/tfjob](https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/tree/master/deployments/examples/tfjob)
2. To build this docker image with the following command

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0 .
```

## Run a TensorFlow job
Here is a TFJob yaml for MNIST [example](https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/blob/master/deployments/examples/tfjob/tf-job-mnist.yaml).

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  name: dist-mnist-for-e2e-test
  namespace: kubeflow
spec:
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    PS:
      replicas: 2
      restartPolicy: Never
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            applicationId: "tf_job_20200521_001"
            queue: root.sandbox
        spec:
          schedulerName: yunikorn
          containers:
            - name: tensorflow
              image: kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
    Worker:
      replicas: 4
      restartPolicy: Never
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            applicationId: "tf_job_20200521_001"
            queue: root.sandbox
        spec:
          schedulerName: yunikorn
          containers:
            - name: tensorflow
              image: kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
```
Create the TFJob
```
kubectl create -f deployments/examples/tfjob/tf-job-mnist.yaml
```
You can view the job info from YuniKorn UI. If you do not know how to access the YuniKorn UI,
please read the document [here](../../get_started/get_started.md#access-the-web-ui).

## Using Time-Slicing GPU

### Prerequisite
To use Time-Slicing GPU your cluster must be configured to use GPUs and Time-Slicing GPUs.
- Nodes must have GPUs attached.
- Kubernetes version 1.24
- GPU drivers must be installed on the cluster
- Use the [GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/getting-started.html) to automatically setup and manage the NVIDA software components on the worker nodes.
- Set the Configuration of [Time-Slicing GPUs in Kubernetes](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/gpu-sharing.html)



Once the GPU Operator and Time-Slicing GPUs is installed, check the status of the pods to ensure all the containers are running and the validation is complete :
```shell script
kubectl get pod -n gpu-operator
```
```shell script
NAME                                                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS       AGE
gpu-feature-discovery-fd5x4                                   2/2     Running     0              5d2h
gpu-operator-569d9c8cb-kbn7s                                  1/1     Running     14 (39h ago)   5d2h
gpu-operator-node-feature-discovery-master-84c7c7c6cf-f4sxz   1/1     Running     0              5d2h
gpu-operator-node-feature-discovery-worker-p5plv              1/1     Running     8 (39h ago)    5d2h
nvidia-container-toolkit-daemonset-zq766                      1/1     Running     0              5d2h
nvidia-cuda-validator-5tldf                                   0/1     Completed   0              5d2h
nvidia-dcgm-exporter-95vm8                                    1/1     Running     0              5d2h
nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset-7nzvf                          2/2     Running     0              5d2h
nvidia-device-plugin-validator-gj7nn                          0/1     Completed   0              5d2h
nvidia-operator-validator-nz84d                               1/1     Running     0              5d2h
```
Verify that the time-slicing configuration is applied successfully :

```shell script
kubectl describe node
```

```shell script
Capacity:
  nvidia.com/gpu:     16
...
Allocatable:
  nvidia.com/gpu:     16
...
```
### Testing TensorFlow job with GPUs
This section covers a workload test scenario to validate TFJob with Time-slicing GPU.

1. Create a workload test file `tf-gpu.yaml` as follows:
  ```shell script
  vim tf-gpu.yaml
  ```
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1"
  kind: "TFJob"
  metadata:
    name: "tf-smoke-gpu"
    namespace: kubeflow
  spec:
    tfReplicaSpecs:
      PS:
        replicas: 1
        template:
          metadata:
            creationTimestamp: 
            labels:
              applicationId: "tf_job_20200521_001"
          spec:
            schedulerName: yunikorn
            containers:
              - args:
                  - python
                  - tf_cnn_benchmarks.py
                  - --batch_size=32
                  - --model=resnet50
                  - --variable_update=parameter_server
                  - --flush_stdout=true
                  - --num_gpus=1
                  - --local_parameter_device=cpu
                  - --device=cpu
                  - --data_format=NHWC
                image: docker.io/kubeflow/tf-benchmarks-cpu:v20171202-bdab599-dirty-284af3
                name: tensorflow
                ports:
                  - containerPort: 2222
                    name: tfjob-port
                workingDir: /opt/tf-benchmarks/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks
            restartPolicy: OnFailure
      Worker:
        replicas: 1
        template:
          metadata:
            creationTimestamp: null
            labels:
              applicationId: "tf_job_20200521_001"
          spec:
            schedulerName: yunikorn
            containers:
              - args:
                  - python
                  - tf_cnn_benchmarks.py
                  - --batch_size=32
                  - --model=resnet50
                  - --variable_update=parameter_server
                  - --flush_stdout=true
                  - --num_gpus=1
                  - --local_parameter_device=cpu
                  - --device=gpu
                  - --data_format=NHWC
                image: docker.io/kubeflow/tf-benchmarks-gpu:v20171202-bdab599-dirty-284af3
                name: tensorflow
                ports:
                  - containerPort: 2222
                    name: tfjob-port
                resources:
                  limits:
                    nvidia.com/gpu: 2
                workingDir: /opt/tf-benchmarks/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks
            restartPolicy: OnFailure
  ```
2. Create the TFJob
  ```shell script
  kubectl apply -f tf-gpu.yaml
  ```
3. Verify that TFJob are running on YuniKorn:
  ![tf-job-gpu-on-ui](../../assets/tf-job-gpu-on-ui.png)
    Check the log of the pod:
    ```shell script
    kubectl logs logs po/tf-smoke-gpu-worker-0 -n kubeflow
    ```
    ```
