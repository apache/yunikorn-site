YuniKorn leverages [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to record metrics. The metrics system keeps tracking of
scheduler's critical execution paths, to reveal potential performance bottlenecks. Currently, there are three categories
for these metrics:

- scheduler: generic metrics of the scheduler, such as allocation latency, num of apps etc.
- queue: each queue has its own metrics sub-system, tracking queue status.
- event: record various changes of events in YuniKorn.

all metrics are declared in `yunikorn` namespace.
###    Scheduler Metrics

| Metrics Name          | Metrics Type | Description  | 
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| containerAllocation   | Counter      | Total number of attempts to allocate containers. State of the attempt includes `allocated`, `rejected`, `error`, `released`. Increase only. |
| applicationSubmission | Counter      | Total number of application submissions. State of the attempt includes `accepted` and `rejected`. Increase only. |
| application           | Gauge        | Total number of applications. State of the application includes `running`, `completed` and `failed`.             |
| node                  | Gauge        | Total number of nodes. State of the node includes `active` and `failed`.                                         |
| nodeResourceUsage     | Gauge        | Total resource usage of node, by resource name.                                                                  |
| schedulingLatency     | Histogram    | Latency of the main scheduling routine, in milliseconds.                                                         |
| sortingLatency        | Histogram    | Latency of all nodes sorting, in milliseconds.                                                                   |
| tryNodeLatency        | Histogram    | Latency of node condition checks for container allocations, such as placement constraints, in milliseconds.      |
| tryPreemptionLatency  | Histogram    | Latency of preemption condition checks for container allocations, in milliseconds.                               |

###    Queue Metrics

| Metrics Name              | Metrics Type  | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| appMetrics                | Gauge         | Queue application metrics. State of the application includes `running`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `failed`, `completed`, `allocated`, `released`. |
| ResourceMetrics           | Gauge         | Queue resource metrics. State of the resource includes `guaranteed`, `max`, `allocated`, `pending`, `preempting`. |

###    Event Metrics

| Metrics Name             | Metrics Type  | Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------  | ----------- |
| totalEventsCreated       | Gauge         | Total events created.          |
| totalEventsChanneled     | Gauge         | Total events channeled.        |
| totalEventsNotChanneled  | Gauge         | Total events not channeled.    |
| totalEventsProcessed     | Gauge         | Total events processed.        |
| totalEventsStored        | Gauge         | Total events stored.           |
| totalEventsNotStored     | Gauge         | Total events not stored.       |
| totalEventsCollected     | Gauge         | Total events collected.        |

## Access Metrics

YuniKorn metrics are collected through Prometheus client library, and exposed via scheduler restful service.
Once started, they can be accessed via endpoint http://localhost:9080/ws/v1/metrics.

## Aggregate Metrics to Prometheus

It's simple to setup a Prometheus server to grab YuniKorn metrics periodically. Follow these steps:

- Setup Prometheus (read more from [Prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/))

- Configure Prometheus rules: a sample configuration 

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval:     3s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'yunikorn'
    scrape_interval: 1s
    metrics_path: '/ws/v1/metrics'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['docker.for.mac.host.internal:9080']
```

- start Prometheus

```shell script
docker pull prom/prometheus:latest
docker run -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

Use `docker.for.mac.host.internal` instead of `localhost` if you are running Prometheus in a local docker container
on Mac OS. Once started, open Prometheus web UI: http://localhost:9090/graph. You'll see all available metrics from
YuniKorn scheduler.
