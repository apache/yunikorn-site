# Preemption Design

## Introduction

This design is created to replace the preemption code that has been part of
YuniKorn for a long time.

The original code was never fully tested. After the core cache removal as part
of [YUNIKORN-317](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-317) the
preemption code was taken out of the scheduling path. The only changes that
have gone into the preemption code were compilation fixes. As part of the
preparation for the new preemption design the old code was removed in
[YUNIKORN-1269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1269).

Preemption of workloads is a feature used by almost all schedulers to help
critical workloads run. The criticality can be based on the fact that the
system cannot work without it, i.e. DaemonSets on K8s, or based on some
other factors like SLA or priority. Preemption for DaemonSet pods was
implemented as part of
[YUNIKORN-1085](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1085). This
design thus focuses on preemption for all other workloads.

## Goals

* Re-use existing Kubernetes objects
* Implement inter-queue preemption
* Priority knowledge inside the core scheduler to support preemption

## Non Goals

* Intra-queue preemption
* Cross node preemption
* Full priority support

## Preemption and Priorities

### Kubernetes

All pods for the entire cluster, across namespaces, are sorted based on
priority for scheduling. A higher-priority will get scheduled before a
lower-priority pod. Preemption within the Kubernetes scheduler is also
based solely on the priority of the pod that is being scheduled. The
full documentation can be found
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/).

The simple rule that governs both scheduling order and preemption behavior is
that a pod with a higher priority is more important than a pod with a lower
priority. This crosses namespaces. There are no boundaries or limitations
that can be set. Pods from a namespace with a higher priority are scheduled
earlier and could trigger the preemption of a pod from another namespace.

Priority of a pod is defined in the pod specification. Priority is a number,
but is referenced in the pod specification via a PriorityClass object. The
object defines a named priority and maps it to a value. In more recent
versions (Kubernetes 1.24 and later), the PriorityClass can also contain a
preemption policy for the scheduling phase. This preemptionPolicy only allows
the pod to opt-out from preempting other lower priority pods during the
scheduling phase. It cannot, and is not designed to, alter preemption behavior
while the pod is running.

The same pod priority is also used during the pod eviction by the kubelet on
the node. For example, if the node has been overloaded and runs out of memory
or CPU, the node can evict pods. These evictions help to keep the node stable.
Pods considered for eviction are ranked on priority among some other factors.

### YuniKorn

The behavior in Kubernetes is all focused on the scheduling cycle. When
looking at preemption from the standpoint of a batch or data processing
workload, we need to take into account the possibility to opt-out while
running. This option does not exist in the current configuration for workloads.

The simple approach for preemption fits in with the service type workloads
that Kubernetes is designed for. Services handle the scale up and or scale
down that could be triggered by preempting one of the pods for that service.

This is not the case when we look at a Spark job as an example. The driver pod
is the manager of the other pods that belong to the same job. When the driver
gets preempted the whole job is impacted. Preempting a driver has a follow-on
effect that could cause multiple pods to be removed from the cluster. For a
large job that could mean hundreds of pods. The impact is far larger than a
single pod. Preempting a manager or originator pod should be prevented as much
as possible.

The other case which we need to account for is an interactive session that
runs on the cluster. This interactive session, like a python notebook, is a
one-off instance and restarts have a wider impact. Preempting an instance
like a notebook is not a desirable outcome either.

Building in all the smarts to know which pods to avoid is difficult, or even
impossible. For all these cases the option to allow a “do not preempt me” flag
on the pod would be required. The design will discuss this option in the Pod
specification.

### Priority limitations

PriorityClass objects which define the priority in a Kubernetes cluster are
cluster-wide objects. The cluster administrator defines the objects and thus
the supported priorities.

There are no limitations on the priority that can be set on a pod. When a pod
is submitted the only check performed is that the PriorityClass specified as
part of the pod specification is defined. Any rogue user can create a pod with
the highest defined priority.

Limiting priorities is possible but requires an API server flag which is
difficult to support in public cloud environments. We cannot rely on the option
to be available in a cluster scheduled by YuniKorn.

## The Laws of Preemption

Prior knowledge of implementing preemption in the Apache YARN scheduler has
been used to create this design. It forms the basis for the "laws of preemption".
These laws, or rules, describe overall preemption behavior.

Preemption for YuniKorn is based on the hierarchical queue model and guaranteed
resources assigned to a queue.

Preemption is used to get the usage of a queue to at least its guaranteed
resource capacity. It cannot guarantee that every queue will get its
guaranteed resource capacity. There are cases that make it impossible to get to
that state. Preemption therefore does not guarantee a final optimal state can
or will be reached. The end state of the queues will normally thus be a usage
that is approximately the guaranteed resource capacity.

An example case that makes it impossible to reach the optimal state is when the
sum of the guaranteed resources for a group of queues is larger than the current
resources available in the cluster. It is impossible to get all queues their
guaranteed resources. More cases like this exist in a hierarchy with maximum
quotas set at a certain point in the hierarchy preventing the optimal state from
being reached.

First an overview of the laws, then the explanation and rationale behind each
of the rules:

1. Preemption policies are strong suggestions, not guarantees
2. Preemption can never leave a queue lower than its guaranteed capacity
3. A task cannot preempt other tasks in the same application
4. A task cannot trigger preemption unless its queue is under its guaranteed
   capacity
5. A task cannot be preempted unless its queue is over its guaranteed capacity
6. A task can only preempt a task with lower or equal priority
7. A task cannot preempt tasks outside its preemption fence (one-way constraint)

Most of the rules given around tasks and queues are there to prevent a
preemption storm or loop. Preempting a task that could trigger a follow-up
preemption should be avoided. The rule described should warrant against that.
Breaking the rules could lead to unpredictable behavior either during
scheduling or application runs.

### Preemption policies are strong suggestions, not guarantees

A pod is able to request not to be preempted. However, this is not a guarantee.
There could be circumstances that the scheduler might still preempt the pod.
This will be a last resort action if no other solution is available. This means
that the preemption policy is a strong suggestion, not a guarantee.

The example use case that could break the rule and preempt a pod that opted out
of preemption is the DaemonSet case. The DaemonSet pod must run on the specified
node. If all pods that are running on that node are either other DaemonSet pods
or pods that have opted out of preemption there is no other choice. A pod that
opted out of preemption will be preempted.

### Preemption can never leave a queue lower than its guaranteed capacity

Guaranteed resource capacities configured on a queue are the optimal resources
for the queue from a preemption point of view. Since preemption attempts to get
a queue at least its guaranteed resources, allowing preemption to reduce a queue
below its guaranteed resource capacity would trigger a further round of
preemption.

When a task is considered for preemption the removal of the task from the
queue's usage must not leave the queue below its guaranteed resource capacity.
If the removal of the task would drop the queue below its guarantee that task
cannot be a candidate.

This could mean that a queue, even when it is above its guarantee, still does
not allow preempting any of the tasks in that queue.

### A task cannot preempt other tasks in the same application

As part of the current design we are only implementing inter-queue preemption.
This rule does not apply for inter-queue preemption. It is documented here to
make extending to intra-queue preemption possible without a rule change.

When a task is considered for preemption the task that triggered the preemption
cannot be from the same application.

### A task cannot trigger preemption unless its queue is under its guaranteed capacity

Preemption attempts to get a queue at least its guaranteed resources. Allowing
preemption for a task in a queue that is already over its guaranteed resource
capacity does not help reaching that goal.

Preemption is not the tool to get a queue to its full maximum resource
capacity. For that reason no tasks in a queue are allowed to trigger
preemption in this case. Normal scheduling will handle the assignment of
resources for queues above their guaranteed capacity.

### A task cannot be preempted unless its queue is over its guaranteed capacity

This is an extension to the rule that prevents a queue from going below its
guaranteed resource capacity. If a queue is already below its guaranteed
capacity, no tasks running in that queue can be considered for preemption.
The queue can already trigger preemption of tasks from other queues. Allowing
preemption to remove more resources from the queue would cause the queue to be
even further from its ideal usage.

### A task can only preempt a task with lower or equal priority

This rule is linked to the default preemption behavior of Kubernetes. There is
however a slight difference when compared to the Kubernetes rule. Kubernetes
only allows pods to preempt other pods with a lower priority, not with equal
priority.

Preemption in YuniKorn has a slightly broader application as we also use it to
allow a queue to use its guaranteed resource capacity. The equality has been
added to allow pods from the same priority running in two different queues to
preempt each other. Without that equality allowance on priorities that
redistribution would be slow and difficult.

### A task cannot preempt tasks outside its preemption fence

This last rule is a specific multi-tenancy rule. YuniKorn allows setting up a
preemption fence on a queue that will limit the possible tasks that can be
considered for preemption. A task can only preempt another task if it runs on
a queue that is located inside the preemption fence. More on preemption
fencing below.

## Preemption Fence

In a cluster that runs workloads for multiple tenants preemption should not be
allowed to preempt a workload from one tenant and give the resources to
another. A tenant in this case does not have to be a company, it could be a
division or business group within the same company. Tenants map to the queue
hierarchy. The queue hierarchy can thus cross tenant boundaries.

To translate this to a YuniKorn centric view: confining preemption to assess
only a part of the queue hierarchy should be possible. For this we want to
introduce a preemption fence. The preemption fence is a setting on the queue
which stops preemption from looking at queues outside the fence boundary.

The preemption fence can be set on any queue at any point in the hierarchy.
It blocks traversing up the queue hierarchy when looking for a victim to
preempt. The fence is a unidirectional fence. It prevents going out (i.e.
higher up the queue hierarchy), but does not prevent coming in (or down) the
queue hierarchy. The below diagram shows an example hierarchy with preemption
fencing applied:

![preemption fencing](./../assets/preemption_fence.png)

The example has three preemption fences defined at different levels. The
arrows describe the preemption flows.

First look at `queue A`.
A fence is defined on the leaf queue which means that preemption is fenced to
that queue. This would limit tasks to find a preemption victim within the
queue. This in effect turns off inter-queue preemption for the leaf
`queue A`. This would be a case for intra-queue preemption only. Note that in
the current design intra-queue preemption is excluded, and we will not
implement this use case. However, we do allow the configuration to be set.

The second fence is set up at the `tenant 1` level. This fence has an impact
on the task running in `queue B`. The tasks in `queue B` can find a victim
to preempt in all queues below the `tenant 1` queue (shown in the diagram with
the _yellow_ arrows).

A similar setup is created for the `tenant 2` queue. However, in this case
there can be preemption from `queue 1` to `queue 2` and vice-versa (shown in
the diagram with the _blue_ arrows).

None of the tasks running in the queues below `tenant 1` or `tenant 2` can
preempt a task from the `system` queue. Tasks in the `system` queue are not
fenced. That means that a task in the `system` queue can check any queue in
the hierarchy (shown in the diagram as the _red_ arrows).

## Preemption Logic

For preemption to be triggered by the default Kubernetes scheduler, the pod
must fit within any namespace quota and no node can be found to allocate the
pod on. Preemption tries to find a node to run the pod on and is focused on
nodes only. All pods on a node with a lower priority are considered candidates
for preemption. The scheduler reduces the candidates to a victim list just
large enough to fit the new pod.

The scheduler tracks the node undergoing preemption in the pod that triggered
the preemption. It does not guarantee, for a number of reasons, that the pod
that triggered the preemption also gets scheduled on the node the pods were
preempted from.

From the YuniKorn side we already have a node focused preemption for DaemonSet
pods. A pod from a DaemonSet must run on a specific node. Preemption is
focused on making space on that node. YuniKorn guarantees that the pod will
run on that node and nothing else will be scheduled on that node until the
DaemonSet pod is scheduled.

Generic preemption in YuniKorn is linked to a queue that is under its
guaranteed quota (**rule 4**). The preemption is only triggered after a delay.
A request must have been pending for at least the preemption delay before
preemption will be considered for it. Instead of looking at a node the first
step is to find victims based on the queue that is over its guaranteed quota
(**rule 5**). If no queues can be found within the preemption fence
(**rule 7**), preemption immediately stops.

The next step is to build a list of victims. This could be from one or
multiple queues. Any pod with a priority higher (**rule 6**) than the pod
triggering the preemption is discarded. The next step is to discard any pod
with resources larger than the over guarantee portion (**rule 2**). Proximity
of the victim queue in the hierarchy to the originating queue that triggers
the preemption might be considered when we decide which victims to preempt.
Details will be worked out during the implementation phase.

Cross node preemption is not supported. Any set of victims that get preempted
must run on the same node. The victims are split into groups per node. A group
of victims, combined with the allocatable space on the node, will decide if
the group is a viable group. Checks must be run to make sure that the pod
will fit the node before starting the preemption. If more than one group is
viable a choice will need to be made. The logic for choosing a group is an
implementation detail.

After choosing a group and indirectly a node, the node is reserved for the
pod. Preemption for the victim list will be triggered and on completion the
pod will be scheduled on the node. The reservation guarantees that the pod
triggering the preemption will be scheduled on that node. As a side effect
the preempted pods that restart can also not “slip back” into the freed up
space on the node while the scheduler waits for all preempted pods to exit.
They could be scheduled on a different node but not stop the pod that
triggered the preemption from being scheduled.

## Preemption Loop Prevention

The rules defined prevent looping and circular preemptions. Testing should
be added to cover each rule and combinations like below.

ReplicaSets are a good example to look at for looping and circular
preemption. Each time a pod from a replica set is removed the ReplicaSet
controller will create a new pod to make sure the set is complete. That
auto-recreate could trigger loops if the rules are not covering all cases
correctly. The case described below should be covered as part of standard
testing.

Example setup: Replica set _Prod Repl_ runs in queue _Prod_. For testing
a replica set _Test Repl_ runs in the queue _Test_. Both queues belong
to the same parent queue (they are siblings). The pods all run with the
same settings for priority and preemption. There is no space left on the
cluster.

Example 1: _Prod_ is under its guaranteed quota and multiple pods of the
replica set are pending. All pods for the _Test Repl_ set are running and
_Test_ is above its guaranteed resource capacity.

Preemption flow case 1: To make room for a _Prod Repl_ pod, a pod from
the _Test Repl_ set is preempted. Both queues will end up above their
guaranteed resource. The _Test Repl_ pod is recreated. It cannot preempt
the _Prod Repl_ pod as that would leave the _Prod_ queue below its
guaranteed resource capacity. The _Test Repl_ pod will have to wait until
resources become available in the cluster. The other pods for the
_Prod Repl_ set will also have to wait. The _Prod_ queue is now above its
guaranteed resource and cannot trigger preemption anymore.

Preemption flow case 2: _Test_, although above its guaranteed resource
capacity, would end up below its guarantee if a pod from _Test Repl_ would be
preempted. No preemption happens and the _Prod Repl_ pods will stay pending
until space becomes available in the cluster.

Preemption flow case 3: To make room for the _Prod Repl_ pod a pod from the
_Test Repl_ set is preempted. The _Prod_ queue, even with the additional pod,
is still below its guaranteed resource. The _Test Repl_ pod is recreated.
_Prod_ is not considered as a queue with victims as it is still below its
guaranteed resources. The _Test Repl_ pod will have to wait until resources
become available in the cluster. The _Prod_ queue can trigger further
preemptions. Preemption checks start from scratch. Depending on the state this
could trigger none or more preemptions from the Test queue.

## Preemption Configuration

### PriorityClass

As part of the pod specification we need to be able to provide the ability to
opt-out of preemption. Allowing a user to specify the opt-out directly on the
pod independent of the priority causes a disconnect between Kubernetes and
YuniKorn preemption configuration. It also removes control from the
administrator of the cluster to define which priorities should not be able
to opt out.

One of the goals of the design is to not introduce new objects in Kubernetes.
Combined with the above control and management of the opt-out functionality
at a cluster level the design reuses the existing PriorityClass object.
We cannot and must not break existing functionality of the default Kubernetes
scheduler when we do this. The plugin version of Kubernetes relies on the
default scheduler and its behavior. Pods will use the priorityClassName just
like standard Kubernetes.

The PriorityClass object allows specifying a _preemptionPolicy_ with two
possible values:
* PreemptLowerPriority
* Never

The values are hard-coded in the core types and validations. Adding a new
value is not possible without making a Kubernetes change. That means we cannot
reuse the _preemptionPolicy_ field itself. The content of the field will be
propagated to the scheduling core to allow YuniKorn to take the setting into
account while scheduling.

Just like all other objects in Kubernetes, the PriorityClass object extends
the base object and includes metadata. As part of the metadata we can set
labels and or annotations on the object. Labels are more restrictive than
annotations. As a generic rule we prefer to use annotations over labels for
all the extensions we are adding.

The proposal is to add an annotation to the PriorityClass that allows an
opt-out of preemption. The name of the annotation would follow the same
structure as we use for all other annotations:
  `yunikorn.apache.org/allow-preemption`

As the value of the annotation the proposal is to use a boolean value:
* "true":	allow the pod to be preempted,
* "false":	do not allow preemption
If no value is set for _allow-preemption_ the default value _true_ is used.

The design comes with a caveat. The value of "_false_" for the annotation
on the PriorityClass provides the possibility for a pod to request not to
be preempted. However, this is not a guarantee. There could be
circumstances that the scheduler might still preempt the pod. This will be
a last resort action if no other solution is available. This means that the
preemption policy as defined above is a strong suggestion, not a guarantee.

The example use case that could break the rule and preempt a pod with
_allow-preemption_ set to _false_ is the DaemonSet case. The DaemonSet pod
must run on the specified node. If all pods that are running on that node
are either other DaemonSet pods or pods that have _allow-preemption_ set
to _false_ there is no other choice. A pod that opted out of preemption
will be preempted.

### Application Settings

Priority is part of the pod specification on Kubernetes. Every pod is
converted into an AllocationAsk by the k8shim. As part of the DaemonSet
preemption that was implemented in
[YUNIKORN-1085](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1085) the
priority of a pod is read and set on the AllocationAsk that is created. The
priority that is passed on currently is just a plain integer value, we do not
need more than that.

As part of preemption we need two additional values to be passed on. These two
values together form the preemptionPolicy for YuniKorn. The values must be
communicated as part of the AllocationAsk sent from the Kubernetes shim to the
core. Both values are mapped to the content of the PriorityClass described above.
Instead of adding two separate fields, wrapping them into a new message will
provide more clarity.

The preemption policy can be processed for any AllocationAsk, even if it has
the `Originator` flag in the message set to _false_. Specifying different
preemption behavior for different asks within an application could be important
to allow low-cost asks to be preempted while high-cost asks opt-out.

The use case is again a Spark application. You want the driver pod to opt-out
from preemption and, possibly, preempt other pods during scheduling. An executor
should do neither.

In protobuf message form that would look like:

```
message AllocationAsk {
  ...
  // The preemption policy for this ask
  PreemptionPolicy preemptionPolicy = 12;
}

message PreemptionPolicy {
  // Allow preemption while running
  // Based on the YuniKorn annotation from the PriorityClass object
  bool allowPreemption = 1;
  // Preemption behavior while scheduling
  // Based on the K8s preemptionPolicy from the PriorityClass object
  string schedulerPreemption = 2;
}
```

### Queue Configuration

Two new attributes will be added to the queue configuration object to allow
specifying the preemption fence type and preemption delay. Both properties,
`preemption.policy` and `preemption.delay`, can be set on any queue. The
attributes are part of the queue properties as follows:

```yaml
queues:
  - name: fencedqueue
    properties:
      preemption.policy: fence
      preemption.delay: 30s
```

Properties are fully supported in child templates. Support for setting these
properties for dynamic queues is included as part of the existing
functionality.

The _preemption.policy_ property can be set on the root queue but has no effect.
The root queue as the top of the hierarchy has no parent. This means preemption
cannot traverse further up the tree. No messages will be logged if the
_preemption.policy_ is set on the root queue.

The supported values for the _preemption.policy_ are:
* default
* fence
* disabled

If the value `fence` is set on a queue, tasks running in or below the queue on
which the property is set cannot preempt tasks outside the queue tree. The
value `default` does not limit preemption to the subtree. If no policy is set
the value `default` is used.

A _preemption.delay_ can only be set on a leaf queue. The leaf queue contains
the tasks. Tasks trigger the preemption in combination with a queue being below
its guaranteed resource capacity. Setting a preemption delay on a queue that is
not a leaf has no effect. No messages will be logged if a _preemption.delay_ is
set on a parent queue.

The _preemption.delay_ value must be a valid Golang duration in string form. The
value will be converted into a duration using `ParseDuration` as defined in the
time package.

A _preemption.delay_, if specified, must be larger than `0s`. If no
_preemption.delay_ property is specified in the queue the default of `30s` is
used. If parsing of the string fails the default of `30s` is used.

## Scheduler storage object changes

### AllocationAsk

In line with the changes for the communication the objects in the scheduler also
need to be modified to persist some of the detail communicated. For the
AllocationAsk we need to store both new fields.

Proposed new fields: _allowPreemption_ and _schedulerPreemption_

 - _schedulerPreemption_ is only used during the scheduling phase.  
 - _allowPreemption_ will be propagated to the resulting allocation as defined
   below.  

### Allocation

The allocation that gets created based on the AllocationAsk needs a new field.
This removes the need to check the underlying AllocationAsk if it allows
preemption or not. The scheduler preemption value is not required in the
Allocation.

Proposed new field: _allowPreemption_  

### Queue

The new preemption policy and delay values will need to be stored in the Queue
object. The configuration object does not change as we use the properties of
the Queue in the configuration to store them.

Proposed new fields: _preemptionPolicy_ and _preemptionDelay_
