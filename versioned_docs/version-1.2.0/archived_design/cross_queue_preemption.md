## Problems:

According to lessons we learned from YARN Scheduler preemption. 

**Here're top bad things:** 

- Preemption is a shotgun instead of a sniper, when a preemption decision is made, nobody knows if preempted resources will go to demanding queue/app/user or not.
- Preemption logic and allocation is different, we have to implement (and mimic) what we have done in scheduler allocation logic. 

**Here're top good things:**

- Preemption is fast (thanks to the shotgun), reclaiming thousands of containers only takes ~ 1 sec. 
- We have understand how painful it is to handle DRF, multiple preemption policies (inter/intra-queue, shotgun/surgical preemption, etc.) And we have developed some good logic 
to make sure better modularization and plug-ability  

## Answer some questions for design/implementation choices

**1\. Do we really want preemption-delay? (Or we just want to control pace)**

In CS, we have preemption-delay, which select victims in preemption candidates, wait for a certain time before killing it. 

The purposes of preemption delay are: a. give heads-up time to apps so 
they can prepare bad things happen (unfortunately no app do anything for these heads up, at least from what I knew). b. control preemption pace.   

And in practice, I found it causes a lot of issues, for example when a 
cluster state keep changing, it is very hard to ensure accurate preemption. 

**Proposal:**

Remove the preemption-delay, keep the logics of controlling preemption pace. (such as ```yarn.resourcemanager.monitor.capacity.preemption
.total_preemption_per_round```). And we can do allocation together with preemption.
This don't mean containers will be stopped immediately after preemption issued. Instead, RM can control delays between signal a container and kill a container. Such as grace 
termination of POD in K8s: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods   

**2\. Do we want to do preemption for every scheduling logic, or we can do periodically?**

In CS, we have preemption logic runs periodically, like every 1 sec or 3 sec. 

Since preemption logic involves some heavy logics, like calculating shares of queues/apps. And when doing accurate preemption, we may need to scan nodes for preemption candidate. 
Considering this, I propose to have preemption runs periodically. But it is important to note that, we need to try to use as much code as possible for 
allocation-inside-preemption, otherwise there will be too much duplicated logic and very hard to be maintained in the future.

**3\. Preemption cost and function**

We found it is helpful to add cost for preemption, such as container live time, priority, type of container. It could be a cost function (Which returns a numeric value) or it 
could be a comparator (which compare two allocations for preemption ask).

## Pseudo code

Logic of allocation (invoked every allocation cycle)

```
input:
  - nAlloc, allocate N allocations for this allocation cycle.

for partition: 
  askCandidates := findAskCandidates(nAlloc, preemption=false)
  
  allocated, failed_to_allocated := tryAllocate(askCandidates);
  
  send-allocated-to-cache-to-commit;
  
  update-missed-opportunity (allocated, failed_to_allocated);
  
  nAlloc -= len(allocated)   
```

Logic of preemption (invoked every preemption cycle)

```
// It has to be done for every preemption-policy because calculation is different.
for preemption-policy: 
  preempt_results := policy.preempt()
  for preempt_results: 
     send-preempt-result-to-cache-to-commit;
     updated-missed-opportunity (allocated)
```

Inside preemption policy

```
inter-queue-preempt-policy:
  calculate-preemption-quotas;
  
  for partitions:
    total_preempted := resource(0);
    
    while total_preempted < partition-limited:
      // queues will be sorted by allocating - preempting
      // And ignore any key in preemption_mask
      askCandidates := findAskCandidates(N, preemption=true)
      
      preempt_results := tryAllocate(askCandidates, preemption=true);
      
      total_preempted += sigma(preempt_result.allocResource)
      
      send-allocated-to-cache-to-commit;
      
      update-missed-opportunity (allocated, failed_to_allocated);
      
      update-preemption-mask(askCandidates.allocKeys - preempt_results.allocKeys)
```
