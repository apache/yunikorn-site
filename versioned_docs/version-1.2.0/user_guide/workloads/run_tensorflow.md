This guide gives an overview of how to set up [training-operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator)
and how to run a Tensorflow job with YuniKorn scheduler. The training-operator is a unified training operator maintained by
Kubeflow. It not only supports TensorFlow but also PyTorch, XGboots, etc.

## Install training-operator
You can use the following command to install training operator in kubeflow namespace by default. If you have problems with installation,
please refer to [this doc](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator#installation) for details.
```
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/manifests/overlays/standalone?ref=v1.3.0"
```

## Prepare the docker image
Before you start running a TensorFlow job on Kubernetes, you'll need to build the docker image.
1. Download files from [deployment/examples/tfjob](https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/tree/master/deployments/examples/tfjob)
2. To build this docker image with the following command

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0 .
```

## Run a TensorFlow job
Here is a TFJob yaml for MNIST [example](https://github.com/apache/yunikorn-k8shim/blob/master/deployments/examples/tfjob/tf-job-mnist.yaml).

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  name: dist-mnist-for-e2e-test
  namespace: kubeflow
spec:
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    PS:
      replicas: 2
      restartPolicy: Never
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            applicationId: "tf_job_20200521_001"
            queue: root.sandbox
        spec:
          schedulerName: yunikorn
          containers:
            - name: tensorflow
              image: kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
    Worker:
      replicas: 4
      restartPolicy: Never
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            applicationId: "tf_job_20200521_001"
            queue: root.sandbox
        spec:
          schedulerName: yunikorn
          containers:
            - name: tensorflow
              image: kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
```
Create the TFJob
```
kubectl create -f deployments/examples/tfjob/tf-job-mnist.yaml
```
You can view the job info from YuniKorn UI. If you do not know how to access the YuniKorn UI,
please read the document [here](../../get_started/get_started.md#access-the-web-ui).
