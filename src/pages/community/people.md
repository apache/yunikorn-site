## Become a Committer

Committers are the community members who have the write access to the project's repositories, i.e
they can modify the code by themselves and accept others contributions to all YuniKorn repos.
There is no strict rules about the qualification of a candidate. The PMC votes for a candidate
based on various considerations:

- Code contributions
    - Consistent code contributions
    - Optimize the CI/CD pipeline
    - Help with the code reviews
    - Test and verify release candidates
    - Performance tuning and related tools development
    - Propose improvement proposals

- Non-code contributions
    - Involvement in the community activities, such as meetings, meetups, etc.
    - Provide feedback, report issues, and participate in roadmap discussions
    - Help on project releases
    - Improve project documentation
    - Help the project adoption
    - Integrate with other projects, extend the use cases

Contributor or non-contributor can both make their paths to committer, the community deeply
appreciates both code or non-code contributions.

## Become a PMC member

PMC stands for the Project Management Committee. It is responsible for project management, governance and ensures
the project can be operated under the [Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/).
The committee makes decisions based on the PMC members' votes. A PMC member has the authority to cast a binding
vote on various things, such as project releases, adding new committer or PMC member, etc.

A contributor must become a committer first before becoming a PMC member.
There is no strict rules of when a committer will be qualified for being added to PMC. The management
committee makes a decision based on the involvement and impact of each committer. In general, a committer
who makes consistent code or non-code contributions to the project should be considered as a PMC candidate.
