## Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) Maturity self assessment

This is an assessment of the maturity of Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) as an Apache project.
It is intended to inform the decision (of mentors, community, incubator PMC and ASF Board of Directors) to graduate YuniKorn as a top-level Apache project.
It is based on the [ASF project maturity model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

### Maturity Model Assessment
Mentors and community members are encouraged to contribute to this page and comment on it, the following table summarizes project’s self-assessment against the Apache Maturity Model.

| CD20 | Anyone can easily discover and access the project’s code.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The source code is available from a set of git repositories, linked from the YuniKorn website.                                                                                                                                                      |
| CD30 | Anyone using standard, widely-available tools, can build the code in a reproducible way.                                                                                                                                                                       | The source code is automatically built for each Pull Request commit, with license checks, unit and end to end tests, via GitHub actions. Development environment setup and build instructions to do the same locally are documented on the website. |
| CD40 | The full history of the project’s code is available via a source code control system, in a way that allows anyone to recreate any released version.                                                                                                            | The commit history is available from the beginning of the project. All releases that have been made during the incubation period are tagged in the repository.                                                                                      |
| CD50 | The source code control system establishes the provenance of each line of code in a reliable way, based on strong authentication of the committer. When third parties contribute code, commit messages provide reliable information about the code provenance. | The project uses multiple git repositories, all managed by Apache Infra, ensuring provenance of each line of code to a committer. All code is checked in after review and approval of a GitHub pull-request.                                        |

| LC20 | Libraries that are mandatory dependencies of the project’s code do not create more restrictions than the Apache License does.                                                                                                                                  | The list of mandatory dependencies have been reviewed to contain approved licenses only.                                                                                                                                                            |

| LC40 | Committers are bound by an Individual Contributor Agreement (the "Apache iCLA") that defines which code they may commit and how they need to identify code that is not their own.                                                                              | The project uses a repository managed by Apache Infra, write access requires an Apache account, which requires an ICLA on file.                                                                                                                     |
| LC50 | The project clearly defines and documents the copyright ownership of everything that the project produces.                                                                                                                                                     | All files in the source repository have appropriate headers. An automated process as part of the pre-commit workflow is in place to ensure every file has the expected license header.                                                              |

| RE10 | Releases consist of source code, distributed using standard and open archive formats that are expected to stay readable in the long term.                                                                                                                      | Recent releases are available via the download page on the website. All releases are available via the archive https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/yunikorn/. Source code and docker images are linked to from the website.                   |
| RE20 | The project’s PMC (Project Management Committee, see CS10) approves each software release in order to make the release an act of the Foundation.                                                                                                               | All incubating releases have been approved by the YuniKorn community and the Incubator, all with at least 3 (P)PMC votes and more +1 than -1.                                                                                                       |
| RE30 | Releases are signed and/or distributed along with digests that anyone can reliably use to validate the downloaded archives.                                                                                                                                    | Releases are signed, the keys are available from the YuniKorn download page. Every release has a SHA-512 checksum to prevent content tampering.                                                                                                     |
| RE40 | The project can distribute convenience binaries alongside source code, but they are not Apache Releases, they are provided with no guarantee.                                                                                                                  | Docker images are available from Dockerhub under the Apache account.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| RE50 | The project documents a repeatable release process so that someone new to the project can independently generate the complete set of artifacts required for a release.                                                                                         | The processes to create and check a release are documented. The release process is almost fully automated. Each of the five releases made so far during the incubation period has used a different release manager.                                 |

| QU10 | The project is open and honest about the quality of its code. Various levels of quality and maturity for various modules are natural and acceptable as long as they are clearly communicated.                                                                  | Open issues are listed in the public Jira and discussed in JIRA, on chat and the mailing list.                                                                                                                                                      |
| QU20 | The project puts a very high priority on producing secure software.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Security issues are treated with the highest priority.

| QU30 | The project provides a well-documented, secure and private channel to report security issues, along with a documented way of responding to them.                                                                                                               | The process to report a security issue is documented on the website: https://yunikorn.apache.org/community/how_to_contribute#report-a-security-issue.                                                                                               |
| QU40 | The project puts a high priority on backwards compatibility and aims to document any incompatible changes and provide tools and documentation to help users transition to new features.                                                                        | Each release contains a "Release Announcement" on the website containing the release notes (extracted from Jira).
