_Abstract_: Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) has released v0.11 earlier this year with a number of new features and improvements
like Gang scheduling, REST API enhancements and Kubernetes 1.19 support. In a month, we are planning the major
v1.0.0 release with Kubernetes 1.20 & 1.21 support, improved node sorting and numerous small fixes & enhancements! In this meetup, we will deep dive into the implementation of Gang scheduling behind the use of temporary
placeholder pods on Kubernetes, significant performance improvement with simplified scheduler core code and
a new node sorting algorithm. Please find all the topics for this meetup [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NP0J22-Gp3cZ_hfKyA9htXJw7tlk-BmljF-7CBJg44).
