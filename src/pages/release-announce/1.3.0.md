# Release Announcement v1.3.0
We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to
release 1.3.0. Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed
for managing and scheduling Big Data workloads on container orchestration
frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview
The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 160
[JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12352568)
in this release.

Release manager: Yu Teng Chen

Release date: 2023-06-09

## Highlights

### Kubernetes version support
YuniKorn 1.3.0 supports running on Kubernetes clusters from version 1.21
through 1.26. Support for running on Kubernetes 1.27 is **not** supported,
but is planned for YuniKorn 1.4.0.

**NOTE**: YuniKorn 1.3.0 is the last release planned which will support
Kubernetes 1.21 through 1.23; YuniKorn 1.4.0 is expected to require Kubernetes
1.24 or later.

Please see [YUNIKORN-1699](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1699)
for details.

### Preemption support
YuniKorn now has comprehensive support for preemption, including customizable
policies per queue. Please see the the Preemption
[design documentation](https://yunikorn.apache.org/docs/next/design/preemption)
for more details.

JIRA: [YUNIKORN-1461](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1461)

### Better support for BestEffort pods
YuniKorn now tracks the number of pods scheduled as part of queue quota limits.
This allows limiting parallelism within a queue, but also provides better
support for running Kubernetes pods with the `PodQOSBestEffort` scheduling class
(i.e. those with no explicit resources requested).

Please see [YUNIKORN-1632](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1632)
for details.

### Lighter and more secure images
YuniKorn 1.3.0 has moved to using scratch base images for all containers. This
results in a smaller footprint as well as improved security as YuniKorn no
longer ships any third-party software in our container images.

A prerequisite for using scratch images was the move from nginx to a go-based
web server for the web application. Please see
[YUNIKORN-1672](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1672) and
[YUNIKORN-1535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1535) for
details.

### Dynamic namespace support in admission controller
The YuniKorn admission controller now suports per-namespace annotations to
control YuniKorn-specific processing. Previously, only a static list of
regular expressions (still supported) could be used to select namespaces.

Please see [YUNIKORN-1647](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1647)
for details.

### CPU and memory optimization
YuniKorn 1.3.0 contains several optimizations for CPU and memory usage, making
this release the lightest and fastest yet. Some examples:

* [YUNIKORN-1719](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1719)
  Improve the performance of Application.sortRequests()
* [YUNIKORN-1720](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1720)
  Improve the performance of node.preAllocateCheck()
* [YUNIKORN-1722](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1722)
  Excessive resource clone calls in calculateNodesResourceUsage()
* [YUNIKORN-1746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1746) 
  Improve the performance of nodeInfoListerImpl.List()

## Community
