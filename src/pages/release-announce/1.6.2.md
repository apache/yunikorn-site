# Release Announcement v1.6.2

We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.6.2.
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview

The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 10 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353867#) in this release.

Release manager: Wilfred Spiegelenburg

Release date: 2025-03-18

## Highlights

This release is a bugfix release only and contains a critical fix for a regression found in YuniKorn 1.6.0 and YuniKorn 1.6.1.
The only other changes included are updates for dependencies related to CVEs. **All users of 1.6.0 and 1.6.1 are urged to upgrade.**

### Re-introduction of race condition

**Critical**: A change included in YuniKorn 1.6.0 and YuniKorn 1.6.1 re-introduces a race condition fixed in YuniKorn 1.4.0.
The regression was caused by a partial revert of the fix from [YUNIKORN-1993](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1993)
Fixed in [YUNIKORN-3036](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3036).

### CVE fixes

YuniKorn 1.6.2 is now build with Go 1.23.7. The standard libraries from Go are also updated.

The Kubernetes version YuniKorn builds with is not updated. The CVEs fixed in the upgraded Kubernetes versions are not relevant.
The code affected is either not used in YuniKorn or only affect Microsoft Windows which is not a supported operating system.

Fixed in:
* [YUNIKORN-3024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3034)
* [YUNIKORN-3029](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3029)
* [YUNIKORN-3030](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3030)
* [YUNIKORN-3040](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3040)
* [YUNIKORN-3041](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3041)
* [YUNIKORN-3042](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3042)
* [YUNIKORN-3043](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3043)

:::note
[YUNIKORN-3004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3004) was incorrectly marked as fixed in YuniKorn release 1.6.1 and 1.6.2.
The fix was correctly backported and released in YuniKorn 1.6.3.

### Improper locking in user/group tracking

YuniKorn could update internal accounting structures unsafely and panic in some cases.
