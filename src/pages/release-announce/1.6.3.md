# Release Announcement v1.6.3

We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.6.3.
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview

The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 1 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353905) in this release.

Release manager: Wilfred Spiegelenburg

Release date: 2025-05-06

## Highlights

This release is a single bugfix release and contains a critical fix for an issue marked as fixed in YuniKorn 1.6.1 and YuniKorn 1.6.2.

### Improper locking in user/group tracking

YuniKorn could update internal accounting structures unsafely and panic in some cases.

[YUNIKORN-3004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3004) was incorrectly marked as fixed in YuniKorn release 1.6.1 and 1.6.2.
YuniKorn 1..6.1 and 1.6.2 can panic due to improper locking while reading and writing user quota tracking data.
