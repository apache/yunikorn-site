# Release Announcement v1.5.1
We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.5.1. 
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview
The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 18 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353383) in this release.

Release manager: Peter Bacsko

Release date: 2024-05-16

## Highlights

### Locking fixes to avoid existing and potential deadlocks

YuniKorn 1.5.0 contained a deadlock as described in [YUNIKORN-2521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2521).
This deadlock is now fixed along with other potential deadlocks. See [YUNIKORN-2544](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2544)
for a more detailed overview of the locking changes made.

### Deadlock detection

The tool [go-deadlock](https://github.com/sasha-s/go-deadlock) has been integrated to the codebase,
which makes it possible to detect potential deadlocks at runtime. Since this slows down the scheduler
and increases memory usage, it's disabled by default. However, it's enabled during the unit test phase
with "make test". See [YUNIKORN-2539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2539) for details.
