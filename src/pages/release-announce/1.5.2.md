# Release Announcement v1.5.2
We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.5.2. 
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview
The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 17 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353487) in this release.

Release manager: Peter Bacsko

Release date: 2024-07-26

## Highlights
### Locking fix to avoid deadlock on node addition
Yunikorn could enter a deadlock when a node is added during scheduling. This is now fixed, see [YUNIKORN-2629](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2629) for details.

### CSINodes informer
Node volume limits and other that scheduling actions that relied on the CSINode objects failed as the CSINode informer was not started. This was fixed in [YUNIKORN-2621](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2621) and the CSINode informer now gets started by default.

### Skip setting the default queue name
The default queue name no longer gets set on the pod to allow placement rules to be executed correctly in specific configurations. Placement behaviour has not changed except for the specific configurations. Details are in [YUNIKORN-2703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2703) and [YUNIKORN-2711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2711).
