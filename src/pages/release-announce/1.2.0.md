# Release Announcement v1.2.0
We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.2.0. Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing, and scheduling Big Data workloads on container orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview
The Apache YuniKorn community has fixed 150 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12352194) in this release.

Release manager: Manikandan R

Release date: 2023-02-02

## Highlights

### User Quota Tracking
User & Group resource usage are being tracked at queue level considering its hierarchical structure too for property overriding preference as well. Please see [YUNIKORN-984](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-984) for details.

### Enhanced User & Group handling
User & Group handling mechanism has been enhanced, which in turn opened up various ways to detect the User and its associated group. Please see [YUNIKORN-1306](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1306) for details.

### Support app/task priority aware scheduling
In addition to Fair & FIFO based application sorting policies, Priority based sorting has been designed and implemented in such a way to be compatible with Kubernetes standard priority handling wherever possible. Please see [YUNIKORN-1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1) for details.

### Support arbitrary resources in namespace annotation
Support for all resource types in namespace annotations is possible now. Earlier only cpu and memory resource type is allowed. Please see [YUNIKORN-1275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1275) for details.

### Build YuniKorn against Kubernetes 1.23
This will allow us to maintain support for running on 1.21 and later clusters, while also supporting newer scheduler features. Please see [YUNIKORN-1348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1348) for details.

### Configuration V2
The configuration system has been overhauled [YUNIKORN-1221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1221):
- REST interface for config update has been removed
- New config map: yunikorn-defaults managed via helm
- Existing config map retained.<br>Please read https://yunikorn.apache.org/docs/next/design/config_v2 for details

### Revamping e2e testing
Stabilization of various end-to-end tests has been covered as part of [YUNIKORN-1491](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1491).

## Community
The Apache YuniKorn community is pleased to welcome new PMC member Tingyao Huang and committer Rainie Li.
