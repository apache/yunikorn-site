# Release Announcement v1.6.0
We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.6.0. 
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview
The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 316 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12352202) in this release.

Release manager: Peter Bacsko

Release date: 2024-09-17

## Highlights

### Kubernetes version support

YuniKorn 1.6.0 supports running on Kubernetes clusters from version 1.24 through 1.31.
See [YUNIKORN-2830](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2830) for details.

### Unification of Ask and Allocation

YuniKorn 1.6.0 has been simplified on a code level - we no longer have "Ask" objects in
the scheduler core. A resource ask is simply an allocation without a node assigned
to it. See [YUNIKORN-2457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2457) for
details. 

### Preemption hardening

After a more thorough analysis of the preemption feature, we identified several use cases where
it works either inconsistently or produces unexpected, non-intuitive results.
See [YUNIKORN-2493](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2493) for details.

### Establish consistent usage guidelines for labels and annotations

Before YuniKorn 1.6.0, labels and annotations were not used in a consistent way.
Certain metadata existed either as a label or annotation. If it existed for both,
the precedence was not clear. If both were defined with different values, no error
was reported. This was fixed in [YUNIKORN-2501](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2501).

### Support for OIDC credentials

In [YUNIKORN-2281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2281) we added support
for OIDC user names. Previously, these were rejected in the admission controller
because certain characters were treated as illegal. 

### Improved code quality

In [YUNIKORN-182](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-182) we improved the
code quality of Yunikorn so that the Go linters no longer complain about potential
coding problems.

Coverage of various parts of the code was significantly enhanced. See the [JIRA filter](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353613)
for the list of items.

### Deadlock detection, fixed potential locking issues

The tool [go-deadlock](https://github.com/sasha-s/go-deadlock) has been integrated to the codebase,
which makes it possible to detect potential deadlocks at runtime. Since this slows down the scheduler
and increases memory usage, it's disabled by default. However, it's enabled during the unit test phase
with "make test". See [YUNIKORN-2539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2539) for details.

With go-deadlock, several potential deadlocks have been identified and fixed in
[YUNIKORN-2544](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2544).

### Reproducible binaries

Before YuniKorn 1.6.0, the binaries we build for YuniKorn differ from one build to the next.
We standardized our build output so that independently built binaries from the same source code can be validated.
See [YUNIKORN-2419](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2419).

## Incompatible changes

### Removed StateAware scheduling

State-aware scheduling has been removed in YuniKorn 1.6.0.

### Plugin mode is deprecated

From YuniKorn 1.6.0, the plugin mode is considered deprecated and no new plugin-related
code will be added.

### Fair queue sorting has changed

The previous version of the fair share sorting algorithm was broken and did not return
the ratio correctly. This is now fixed in [YUNIKORN-2678](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2678).
This change fundamentally affects scheduling decisions, because in each cycle the scheduler might end up choosing
a different pending request than it did before.

### Default queue is no longer set on the pod

From YuniKorn 1.6.0, the admission controller no longer updates the queue label on the pod if it's unset.
See [YUNIKORN-2711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2711) for details.
