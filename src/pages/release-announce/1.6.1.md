# Release Announcement v1.6.1

We are pleased to announce that the Apache YuniKorn community has voted to release 1.6.1.
Apache YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler, designed for managing and scheduling Batch and Data workloads on container
orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes for on-prem and on-cloud use cases.

## Overview

The Apache YuniKorn community has resolved 12 [JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12353775#) in this release.

Release manager: Craig Condit

Release date: 2025-01-24

## Highlights

This release is primarily a bugfix release and contains critical fixes for issues found in YuniKorn 1.6.0. **All users of 1.6.0 are urged to upgrade.**

### Orphan allocation due to reservation host mismatch

**Critical**: YuniKorn 1.6.0 can improperly assign an allocation to the wrong host
when a reservation on one node is fulfilled on a different one.
Fixed in [YUNIKORN-2978](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2978).

### Improper locking during Kubernetes event handling

**Critical**: A race condition was found which can corrupt internal YuniKorn
data structures when pod and node events are published simultaneously.
Fixed in [YUNIKORN-2910](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2910).

### Scheduling of multiple DaemonSet pods can fail if one is reserved

**Critical**: YuniKorn can fail to allocate a DaemonSet pod in the case where a
different DaemonSet pod was already reserved on the same node.
Fixed in [YUNIKORN-2976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2976).

### Incorrect accounting of preeempted allocations

YuniKorn could mark an allocation as preempted again during it's graceful
shutdown procedure, leading to resource accounting errors.
Fixed in [YUNIKORN-3003](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3003).

### Incorrect count of placeholders released

Placeholder pod releases can be counted twice when cleanup of a timed out pod is
requested.
Fixed in [YUNIKORN-2953](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-2953).

### Helm chart now supports setting GOGC / GOMEMLIMIT

In prior versions, YuniKorn's memory usage was unrestricted and did not
honor container requests or limits. In 1.6.1 and later releases, the YuniKorn
Helm charts support setting these values via the `goGC` and `goMemoryLimit`
attributes. These can be set on the scheduler, admission controller, and web
containers.

**NOTE**: If you have customized YuniKorn's container memory requests or
limits, please ensure `goMemoryLimit` is set to an appopriate value for your
environment. The defaults for each container in the Helm chart correspond to
75% of the default memory limits.

See [YUNIKORN-3000](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3000)
for more information.

:::note
[YUNIKORN-3004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-3004) was incorrectly marked as fixed in YuniKorn release 1.6.1 and 1.6.2
The fix was correctly backported and released in YuniKorn 1.6.3. 

### Improper locking in user/group tracking

YuniKorn could update internal accounting structures unsafely and panic in some cases.
