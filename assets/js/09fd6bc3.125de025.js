Poor application tuning, resource allocation, and scheduling can lead to exorbitant costs on the cloud, sluggish performance, and failed jobs due to the intractable infrastructure search space. Addressing each of these codependent issues separately also often doesn't lead to the best results overall. Sync Computing will share how their autotuner and orchestrator addresses these issues jointly as a single optimization problem. As a result, the solution offers globally optimized Spark configurations, resource provisioning, and job scheduling with configurable optimization goals, enabling a seamless user experience of running DAG workflows in the cloud. We experimentally demonstrate on AWS up to 77% cost savings or 45% performance acceleration of a Spark and Airflow DAG. Simulations of our solution on a multi-day Alibaba cloud trace resulted in a 57% reduction in total DAG completion time for their batch workloads. This work could be complementary to Yunikorn and we would like to discuss potential integration strategies with the community."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Craig Condit from Cloudera will talk about the latest YuniKorn release v0.12.2 and offer a glimpse of what the upcoming v1.0 release has in store.\nDescription:\nv0.12.2 release offers a host of new features and bug fixes.
