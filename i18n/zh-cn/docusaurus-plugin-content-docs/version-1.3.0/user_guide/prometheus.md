YuniKorn exposes its scheduling metrics via Prometheus. Thus, we need to set up a Prometheus server to collect these metrics.

If you don't know what metric can be used, you can use [REST API](../api/scheduler.md#指标(Metrics)).

### 1. **Download Prometheus release**

```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.30.3/prometheus-2.30.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

```bash
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*
```

### 2. **Configure prometheus.yml**

Prometheus collects metrics from *targets* by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval:     3s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'yunikorn'
    scrape_interval: 1s
    metrics_path: '/ws/v1/metrics'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9080'] 
    # 9080 is internal port, need port forward or modify 9080 to service's port
```

### 3. Start port-forward

Port forwarding for the core's web service on the standard port can be turned on via:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/yunikorn-service 9080:9080 -n yunikorn
```

`9080`is the default port for core's web service. 

### 4. Execute prometheus

```bash
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

### 5. Access the Prometheus UI

You should be able to browse to a status page at [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/). Give it a couple of seconds to collect data about itself from its own HTTP metrics endpoint.

You can also verify that Prometheus is serving metrics by navigating to its metrics endpoint:[localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics)
